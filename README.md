# ZombieSharp
<b>Note 04/26/2024: This Project is now paused, as I'm currently learning to become Full-Stack Developer. After I get a new job, I will continue this project again.</b>

<b>This project is linux focusing as Windows has a lot issues with Virtual Functions. However, if Windows issue is solved, the plugin will mostly work fine.</b>
